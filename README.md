> An econometric study examining the relationship between educational attainment, gender, and unemployment risk in Kerala using unit-level data from the NSSO 68th Round.

###  Summary

This project investigates one of Kerala's key socio-economic paradoxes: the persistence of high female unemployment despite high female educational attainment. The study uses a logistic regression model to determine if education's protective effect against unemployment is the same for men and women.

The findings confirm that while higher education significantly reduces unemployment risk for both genders, it **does not close the gender gap**. Women continue to face a structurally higher probability of unemployment, suggesting that barriers beyond educational qualifications—such as social norms and labor market structure—are the primary drivers of this disparity.

###  Key Research Question

Does higher education reduce the risk of unemployment equally for men and women in Kerala, or do the returns to education differ across gender lines?

###  Methodology and Data

* **Data Source:** National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) 68th Round (2011-12), focusing on unit-level household data for Kerala.
* **Statistical Model:** A **Logistic Regression (Logit) Model** was employed to estimate the probability of an individual being unemployed.
* **Key Variables:** The model included educational attainment, gender, sector (rural/urban), age, and an interaction term between education and gender.

###  Key Findings

* **Education is Effective:** Higher educational attainment is strongly and significantly associated with a lower probability of unemployment for both men and women.
* **The Gender Gap Persists:** Women have a statistically significant and structurally higher likelihood of being unemployed than men, even after controlling for education, age, and sector.
* **No Significant Interaction Effect:** The protective effect of education against unemployment was found to be statistically similar for both genders. This implies that education helps everyone, but it is not a specific tool that closes the existing gender gap.

###  Technologies Used

The analysis for this project was conducted using:
* **Software:** R (in R Studio)
* **Tasks:** Data Cleaning & Manipulation, Econometric Modeling (Logistic Regression), Statistical Analysis, and Data Visualization.
